# Defining A Schema In Surrealist

Surrealist allows you to design your schemas both visually in the [designer view](/docs/surrealist/getting-started/designing-the-database-schema) and with [queries in the query view](/docs/surrealist/getting-started/sending-queries), making it easy to create and manage your tables and relationships. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of defining a schema in Surrealist.



## Creating a new schema in designer view

A schema is a blueprint of your database that defines the structure of your tables, the relationships between them, and the constraints that apply to your data. In Surrealist, you can create a new schema in the designer view by defining your tables and their columns, setting primary and foreign keys, and establishing relationships between your tables.

To create a new schema in Surrealist, follow these steps:

1. Open the designer view by clicking on the designer icon in the sidebar.

2. Click on the `+` button to create a new table or relationship between tables.

3. Enter the table name and click on the `create` button.
