# Create a New Connection

In Surrealist there are two ways to create a new connection, using a remote database or via a sandbox.

## Create a new connection to a remote database

To create a new connection using your database credentials, follow these steps: 

1. In the introduction screen, select the `create connection` option. 
2. Enter the required details based on your authentication mode.

    There are multiple connection options available, such as `WS/WSS `, `HTTP/HTTPS`,`Memory` and `IndexDB` that you can configure based on your database setup.
3. Click on the `create` button to establish the connection.
