# `SHOW` statement

The `SHOW` statement can be used to replay changes made to a table.

## Requirements
- You must first [`DEFINE`](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/define/table#example-usage) a [Change Feed](https://surrealdb.com/cf).

### Statement syntax

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
SHOW CHANGES FOR TABLE @tableName SINCE "@timestamp" | "@versionstamp" [LIMIT @number]
```

## Example usage
### Basic usage

The following example shows usage of the SHOW statement.

```surql
-- Define the change feed and its duration
DEFINE TABLE reading CHANGEFEED 3d;

-- Create some records in the reading table
CREATE reading SET story = "Once upon a time";
CREATE reading SET story = "There was a database";
UPDATE reading SET story = story + "!";

-- Replay changes to the reading table since a date
SHOW CHANGES FOR TABLE reading SINCE "2023-09-07T01:23:52Z" LIMIT 10;
-- Or replay changes to the reading table beginning at a version stamp
SHOW CHANGES FOR TABLE reading SINCE 1 LIMIT 10;
```

```bash title="Response to SINCE 1 LIMIT 10"
[
	{
		changes: [
			{
				define_table: {
					name: 'reading'
				}
			}
		],
		versionstamp: 1
	},
	{
		changes: [
			{
				update: {
					id: reading:vfjzrs33worcmqzhd6is,
					story: 'Once upon a time'
				}
			}
		],
		versionstamp: 2
	},
	{
		changes: [
			{
				update: {
					id: reading:6nwrgzygr195fea7hju3,
					story: 'There was a database'
				}
			}
		],
		versionstamp: 3
	},
	{
		changes: [
			{
				update: {
					id: reading:6nwrgzygr195fea7hju3,
					story: 'There was a database!'
				}
			},
			{
				update: {
					id: reading:vfjzrs33worcmqzhd6is,
					story: 'Once upon a time!'
				}
			}
		],
		versionstamp: 4
	}
]
```

:::note
__Note:__ `SINCE <time>` needs to be after the time the `CHANGEFEED` was defined. Also, when defining a `CHANGEFEED` on a table, it implicitly creates a `CHANGEFEED` on the database.
