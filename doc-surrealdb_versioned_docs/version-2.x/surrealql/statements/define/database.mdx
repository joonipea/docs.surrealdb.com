# `DEFINE DATABASE` statement

The `DEFINE DATABASE` statement allows you to instantiate a named database, enabling you to specify security and configuration options.

## Requirements

- You must be authenticated as a root or namespace user before you can use the `DEFINE DATABASE` statement.
- [You must select your namespace](/docs/surrealdb/2.x/surrealql/statements/use) before you can use the `DEFINE DATABASE` statement.

## Statement syntax

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
DEFINE DATABASE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] @name [CHANGEFEED @duration | @versionstamp [INCLUDE ORIGINAL] ]
```

## Example usage 
Below shows how you can create a database using the DEFINE DATABASE statement.

```surql
-- Specify the namespace for the database
USE NS abcum;
-- Define database
DEFINE DATABASE app_vitalsense;
```

## Using `IF NOT EXISTS` clause <l className='purple'>Since 1.3.0</l>

The `IF NOT EXISTS` clause can be used to define a database only if it does not already exist. If the database already exists, the `DEFINE DATABASE` statement will return an error.

```surql
-- Create a DATABASE if it does not already exist
DEFINE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS app_vitalsense;
```

## Changefeeds

A changefeed can be defined on a database, in which case the changefeed will track changes made to every table in the database.

```surql
DEFINE DATABASE my_database CHANGEFEED 3d;

CREATE reading SET story = "Once upon a time";
CREATE reading SET story = "there was a database";
CREATE company SET name = "SurrealDB", stories = (SELECT * FROM story);
UPDATE reading SET story = story + "!";

SHOW CHANGES FOR TABLE reading SINCE 1 LIMIT 10;
SHOW CHANGES FOR TABLE company SINCE 1 LIMIT 10;
```

Note that this creates a single feed across the database, as the `versionstamp` in the output shows.

```bash title="Response"
-- The changes for table `reading` shows up as versionstamp 1, 2, and 4
[
	{
		changes: [
			{
				update: {
					id: reading:gridlbp97uq2o2rzi649,
					story: 'Once upon a time'
				}
			}
		],
		versionstamp: 1
	},
	{
		changes: [
			{
				update: {
					id: reading:ubfw5hk6rwduiwrueyzl,
					story: 'there was a database'
				}
			}
		],
		versionstamp: 2
	},
	{
		changes: [
			{
				update: {
					id: reading:gridlbp97uq2o2rzi649,
					story: 'Once upon a time!'
				}
			},
			{
				update: {
					id: reading:ubfw5hk6rwduiwrueyzl,
					story: 'there was a database!'
				}
			}
		],
		versionstamp: 4
	}
]

-- The change for table `company` shows up as versionstamp 3
[
	{
		changes: [
			{
				update: {
					id: company:z07x3si9gele5xm4hmsk,
					name: 'SurrealDB',
					stories: []
				}
			}
		],
		versionstamp: 3
	}
]
```
